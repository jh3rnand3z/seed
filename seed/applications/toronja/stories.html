            <p>
                We met each other back in 1999 in high school when we started to play historical and life changing games like StarCraft, Half-Life and Quake,who wouldn’t think how a game can really create such a really strong relationship as friends and team mates; while we created our own Clan called Hybrid during that period, since that moment we formalized our long term family that we are now.
            </p>
            <p>
                In all of this years independently everybody have studied and earn experience on different areas of Information, Design and Computation building a strong team.
            </p>
            <p>
                On this latest years we meet up with an idea of building an ambitious high-technology company, by substract all the knowledge we have learned from team work, we first iterate to a company
                called GCS in Costa Rica, for us this was the way to pay the bills without working for someone else and start focusing on our main project.
            </p>
            <p>
                By having our own time and the potential to land all the ideas we
                had during this time,we have come up with IO FUN. Since we
                started this project we got the opportunity to meet really capable
                people with our same interests and all working together to accomplished our goals as a group and as an individual.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we are really excited that the team have achieved too many of the ideas we start 2 years ago and we are looking forward to see what’s the next step in our journey.
