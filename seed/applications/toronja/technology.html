                What we are doing is following the pursuit of John Carmack’s idea of focus on doing a generalized infrastructure, a kind of meta or multiverse build around the internet, concurrency and asynchronous computation.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the past we’ve found Constructivism as the design guide for human universal experiences. For the future, we take Carl Hewitt’s Actors theory as the universal proved model of computation.
            </p>

                We’re making a set of tools, based on common sense, analogies and simple abstractions. We use the name of tropical fruits and animals for our products; Demons, gods or beasts for our services; for us is a way of keep things simple.

                Mango gives us resources to handle, measure and analyze concurrent soft real-time communications, is our business intelligence daemon working with every record at granular level, it’s build with python and concurrent technologies like Tornado and Guido’s “asyncio” Module, our stuff is stored on Postgresql, Mongodb and Riak at the lowest levels of our open source architecture.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Toronja and Seed are the web Javascript applications that interact with mango and other cloud native systems; responsive design with every human in mind.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We’re currently working on Cas: a central actor system for python and Cebus: the artificial intelligence entity that plays with every single daemon running on our virtual tropical cloud.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cebus is our first project in with we mix the results of our research, with the combination of Python and Erlang on the same actor system.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cebus is also the scientific name of the central american Capuchin monkey and we don’t lie when we say that we plan to feed ours with bananas and starfruit’s that talks with networks of asterisks on different places all of that supervising our generalized opensource infrastructure.

                Lets have some fun together on this adventure.
